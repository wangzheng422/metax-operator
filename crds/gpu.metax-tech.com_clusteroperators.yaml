                                  NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node.
                                  Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node.

                                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.

                                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
